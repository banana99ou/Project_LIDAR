# issues:
# .stop() sends stop byte to lidar so chekc what stop byte should be in doc
# and discriptor length
# intergrate stepper motor
# edit cad to have homing switch
# lidar resolution seems to be bit low check it and find way to increase resolution.
# check if mountplate is blocking los to lower angle of lidar
# move this line to github issue page or readme.md file
# detach command and receive side. it's interfering with lidar operation

# milestone
# get lidar working (done)
# get mount printed (done)
# get stepper motor working
# ㄴneed to fix vibration issue
# ㄴneed to find a way to removed sleep function
#  ㄴuse arduino as driver
#  ㄴsepeate program(big issue) or routine
#  ㄴsome other way
# get stepper and lidar working together
# data processing

# idea:
# find milestone management program/website
