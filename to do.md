# issues:
* .stop() sends stop byte to lidar so chekc what stop byte should be in doc
* also look for discriptor length
* ~~need to intergrate stepper motor~~
* ~~need to have homing switch~~
* lidar resolution seems to be bit low check it and find way to increase resolution.
* check if mountplate is blocking los to lower angle of lidar
* ~~move this line to github issue page or readme.md file~~
* detach command and receive side. it's interfering with lidar operation
